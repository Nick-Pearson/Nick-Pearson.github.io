Welcome to my collection of personal projects and research articles. This site is primarily for my own enjoyment, but I'm glad if you find it useful!

Since 2019 I have been working at [BidFX](https://www.bidfx.com/) developing low latency systems in Java for the finance industry. I also previously worked at [Sumo Digital](https://www.sumo-digital.com/) from 2016-17 as a gameplay programmer for a AAA game project in C++

If you'd like to talk more, feel free to reach my on LinkedIn,

Nick
