My entry to part two of the Rising Star code competition, hosted by Aardvark Swift

## Competition

## Development

## Video Breakdown

## Final Result

Despite the numerous issues with my entry I passed through to the final round, and after coming Runner Up was offered a 1 year Placement with Sumo Digital (see [Dead Island 2 @fa-external-link ](/project?p=di2))

I discovered later, in the Documentary created about the competition process, that the main reason I had passed through to the final stage of the competition was my good coding practices.
