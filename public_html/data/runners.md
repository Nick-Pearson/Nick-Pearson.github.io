## Gameplay

Full Metal Runners is a physics-based sports game with large-scale multiplayer built on top of a variety of different animation systems. The player’s main task involves playing a modified version of American Football, where instead of the pitch being a flat plane there are a series of platforms for the player to navigate. A ball is placed at the highest, most central point of the map, and the player has to find and bring it to the opposing team’s goal without being tackled by enemy players.

## Code

The game was developed by a team of 6 as part of the 3rd year computer science program at Bristol University. I was lead programmer so took on a lot of the management tasks for the code base such as ensuring we had good build processes, that the repository was up to date and overseeing the project backlog and bug database. This was a very large project so I wont go into detail about all aspects of it, instead I will just highlight here some of the key features we implemented that I was involved in. The full source code for the game is available on GitHub in the links section.

## Games Day

At the end of the project for our final assessment the department hosts 'Games Day' where any student or member of the public is welcome to come and play the games developed over the course of the year. Over the 3 hour period from 2pm - 5pm we recorded just over 300 players logging in to play our game, in fact we did not have enough space in the room to give everyone who wanted to play a space. This final demo of our systems really proved that the networking systems we had developed worked well and were scalable. We regularly had 20+ players on each of our two servers with only minor issues reported by some clients.
